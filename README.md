# Project Purpose and Aims
The purpose of this project is to try and get a better understanding of Flask as I am quite stuck with my Flask chat room project (https://github.com/JoshuaBilsland/flask-chat-room) as I have tried to dive straight in without learning the building blocks first. I have reached a point with it where I lack sufficient background knowledge in order to complete the last stages of it. My aim with this repo is to follow the tutorials provided by Flask to create the "Flaskr" blog application to hopefully allow me to go back to my chat room project and either finish it or rewrite it from scratch but with a better idea of what I am doing.
